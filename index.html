  Hello Michelle. Just so you know: this is a Google Domain.
</br></br>
Also, thank you for finding my email in the World Wide Web.
</br></br>
I promise I didn’t write anything personal here. At least not about you.
</br></br>
But here is something personal about me that now everyone can Google:
</br></br>
My name is Ana Miraglia.</br>
I was born in Brazil and worked there as a copywriter for 3 years.
</br>
Here’s some of the work that I created there: <a href="http://www.anamiraglia.com/stuffthatgotproduced"> anamiraglia.com/stuffthatgotproduced </a>
</br></br>
I moved to NYC to study at Miami Ad School. Here’s a campaign that I worked on at school, in a partnership with David Miami: <a href="https://bit.ly/2Pt3RIE">https://bit.ly/2Pt3RIE</a>
</br></br>
Even though I’m still in school, I’m already looking for opportunities.
</br>
Don’t tell the school’s staff because they really like me.
</br>
Maybe it’s because I send them checks every month.
</br></br>
Here’s a link to my book: <a href="http://www.anamiraglia.com"> anamiraglia.com </a>
</br></br>
If you like it, maybe we could schedule a call sometime.
</br></br>
The domain www.anasphonenumber.comis available. I’ve checked.
</br></br>
Thank you,
</br></br>
Ana Miraglia
